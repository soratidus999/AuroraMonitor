<H1>1. Introduction</H1>

<P>
The <B>Aurora Monitor</B> graphical application program continuously monitors the
power output and other information from either one or two Power-One Aurora inverters.
It displays continuously updated graphs, numerical values, and alarm status.
</P>
<P>
It also stores the data so that graphs from previous days can be displayed.

<A NAME="toc4"></A>
<H2>2.2. Linux</H2>

<P>
You will need to have the <B>wxWidgets</B> libraries installed on your computer.
</P>
<P>
For Debian, Ubuntu and similar distributions, you need package <B>libwxgtk2.8-0</B> to run
the <B>Aurora Monitor</B> program.  You will also need package <B>libwxgtk2.8-dev</B> to
compile it from the program source code.
</P>
<P>
Alternatively, wxWidgets is available from <A HREF="http://www.wxwidgets.org">www.wxwidgets.org</A>.
</P>
<P>
Run <B>make</B> in the <B>src</B> directory to produce the <B>auroramon</B> executable file.
</P>
<P>
After you have run <B>auroramon</B> and created its data directory, you can copy the

<B>Aurora Monitor</B> creates files in the data directory which is specified in <B>Settings -&gt; Setup</B>.
</P>
<P>
A year directory is created for each year during which data is received from the inverters.
The names of these are the year names eg. <B>2012</B>, <B>2013</B>.
</P>
<P>
A year directory contains:
</P>
<P>
 <BR>
</P>

<A NAME="toc18"></A>
<H2>6.1. Inverter data files</H2>

<P>
There is a file for each inverter and for each day during which data is received.
The file names are of the form:
</P>
<P>
<B>dA_yyyymmdd</B>.txt where <B>A</B> is the inverter address and <B>yyyymmdd</B> is the date.
</P>
<P>
Each line contains the fields.
</P>

<OL>
<LI>Time in the form:  hh:mm:ss
<LI>Output power, Watts
<LI>Input power to string 1, Watts
<LI>Input voltage to string 1, Volts
<LI>Input power to string 2. Watts
<LI>Input voltage to string 2, Volts
<LI>Temperature, degrees C
</OL>

<P>
Each line contains the average of the values which have been received from the inverter during
a 10 second period.  The time shown is the computer time at the start of the period.
</P>
<P>
Additional fields can be added by using the <B>Settings -&gt; Extra readings</B> dialog (see 6.4 below).
These are only read once for each 10 second period.
</P>
<P>
 <BR>
</P>

<A NAME="toc19"></A>
<H2>6.2. Daily totals files</H2>

<P>
There is a single text file for the year for each inverter.
The file name is of the form: <B>inverterN_A_yyyy</B>.txt
where <B>N</B> is inverter number 0 or 1, <B>A</B> is the inverter address, and <B>yyyy</B> is the year.
</P>
<P>
Each line contains the energy totals at the end of a day.
This data is written to the file when the first power reading for the next day is received.
</P>
<P>
If there is a gap of one or more days when the <B>Aurora Monitor</B> program does not run, or does not receive
any data, then those days will not be written to the file and the next day will have a <B>today</B> value
which includes the totals for the missing days.
In this case you could edit the file to add the <B>date</B> and <B>today</B> if you know the values,
for example by using data from the <I>aurora -k</I> command on Linux, or exported from <I>Aurora Communicator</I> on Windows.
This will enable the <B>Aurora Monitor</B> histogram to display correctly.

<P>
 <BR>
</P>

<A NAME="toc20"></A>
<H2>6.3. Five minute energy files</H2>

<P>
The directory <B>yyyy_out</B> (where yyyy is the year) contains a file <B>e5min_yyyymmdd.txt</B> for each inverter
for each day during which data is received.
These contain the total <B>Energy Generated</B> for the day, the instantaneous <B>Power Generated</B>, and the
<B>Grid Voltage</B> at 5 minute intervals in a form which is suitable for pasting into the "Live Loader"
form at <A HREF="http://www.pvoutput.org">www.pvoutput.org</A>.
</P>
<P>
Alternatively, <B>Settings-&gt;PVOutput.org</B> can be used to send data to <A HREF="http://www.pvoutput.org">www.pvoutput.org</A> automatically
every 5, 10, or 15 minutes.
</P>
<P>
Note that <B>Power Generated</B> data for <A HREF="http://www.pvoutput.org">www.pvoutput.org</A> can also be retrieved from the inverter using

Page 2 shows the power input for the 2 strings of Inverter A.  Purple areas show where string 1 provides greater input power
than string 2.  Red areas show where string 2 provides greater power.  If there is only pink and no purple or red, then
both strings are receiving equal power.  This chart is useful (in cases where both strings have the same number of

Page 4 shows the ratio of the power input from the two strings.  This may be useful for showing shading of one or
the other strings.
</P>
<P>
Page 5 shows line graphs of the input voltages from the 2 strings, and also a line graph of the grid voltage.
</P>
<P>
On pages 3, 4, and 5 the power output is also shown for reference as a solid dark grey graph underneath the grid lines.
</P>
<P>
If there are two inverters, then pages 2 to 5 are repeated for the second inverter.

<H2>7.3. Status Bar</H2>

<P>
The <B>Status Bar</B> is below the chart page.  It shows continually updated numerical readings from the inverters.
</P>
<P>
If more than one inverter address has been set, then the contents of the Status Bar can be varied for each
chart page to show the readings for either one or the other inverter, or both.
</P>
<P>
The large number at the far left shows the total output power from both inverters.
</P>
<P>
Next to this is a flashing light for each inverter.
</P>
<P>
It shows <B>green</B> when the inverter is responding.
It flashes <B>green</B> whenever a response is received from that inverter.
It flashes <B>yellow</B> if a request to the inverter had to be re-sent.
</P>
<P>
It shows <B>yellow</B> when the inverter has an alarm, or a status other than normal running.
</P>
<P>
It shows <B>red</B> when there is no communication with the inverter.

<H2>7.4. Extra Readings</H2>

<P>
Extra measurements form the inverters can be displayed, in addition to the graph types listed in 6.1.1 above,
and the default set of numeric values on the Status Bar.
</P>
<P>
Open the <B>Settings -&gt; Extra readings</B> dialog from the menu-bar.  This allows you to add from a list of
extra reading types.  If you check the <B>Numeric</B> option then the reading is added to the Status Bar.  If you
check the <B>Graph</B> option then values for this item are stored in the Inverter Data files (see 5.1 above)
and an additional item is added to the list of graph types in the <B>Chart settings dialog</B>.
</P>
<P>
Some of these extra readings may not produce data on some models of inverter.

<H1>8. Histograms</H1>

<P>
<B>Display -&gt; Histogram</B> or <B>F3</B> shows the Histogram display.
</P>
<P>
<B>Page Down</B> and <B>Page Up</B> changes the display to show <B>Daily</B> values, <B>Weekly average</B> values
or <B>Monthly average</B> values of energy output.
</P>
<P>
The vertical scale can be set by specifying the maximum daily energy value in <B>Settings -&gt; Histogram</B>.
</P>
<P>
If daily values are not available for some days (see <B>Daily totals files</B> above), then the <B>Weekly average</B>
display shows averaged values in dark grey.
</P>
<P>
Double-click on a day in the <B>Daily</B> values display shows the charts for that day.
