# AuroraMonitor
An Open Source alternative for monitoring Aurora (Power-One) Inverters.

Forked from https://sourceforge.net/projects/auroramonitor/ to maintain compatability with newer operating systems.

I also hope to use this repo to recover and maintain some of the older documentation regarding these inverters.
